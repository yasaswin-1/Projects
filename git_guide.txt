Git:-  free and open source version control system
       tools that helps to track changes in code
       ->track history
       ->help to colloborate

GitHub:- online website to host repositories

github:-  code changes -> commit
git:-  code changes -> add -> commit -> push

git --version

Configuring git
    git config --global user.name "yasaswin-1"
    git config --global user.email "saiyasaswin@gmail.com"

git details
    git config --list
    git config user.name
    git config user.email

https://github.com/yasaswin-1/DSA_Repository.git
list hidden files
    ls -a
    ls -la

Basic commands
add
->adds new or changed files in your working directory to the git staging area
    git add filename.type
         git add "add SubsetsBacktracking.java"
        for adding single files one by one (untracked->staged)
    gid add .
        for add all files (untracked->staged)
commit
->it is the record of change
    git commit -m "some message"
        git commit -m "add SubsetsBacktracking.java"
push
->upload local repo content to remote repo
    git push origin main

Pull
->used to fetch and download content from a remote repo and immediately update the local repo to match that content
    git pull origin main
        (checkout to required branch and then pull)

init
->used to create a new git repo
    git init
        (used to make a local repo as git repo by initialising .git file)
    git remote add origin <-link->
    git remote -v (to verify remote)
    git branch (to check branch)
    git branch -M main (to rename branch)
    git push origin main

Branch Commands
    git branch
        (to check branch)
    git branch -M main
        (to rename branch)
    git checkout <- branch name ->
        (to navigate)
    git checkout -b <- new branch name ->
        (to create new branch)
    git branch -d <- branch name ->
        (to delete branch)
    git push --set-upstream origin <- branch name ->
        (manditatory to set for new branch)

Merging Code
    git diff <- branch name ->
        (to compare commits, branches, files & more)
    gir mrege <- branch name ->
        (to merge 2 branches)
        or
        Create a PR (pull request) -> Merge PR -> Confirm Merge (commit) -> Delete the merged branch (as we merged it with main)
Pull Request:- it lets you tell others about changes you've pushed to a branch in a repository on github

Commit and Merge
    git commit -m "merge man" merge with <- other branch name (feature) ->

Ignore Files/Folders
    create " .ignore " folder
        write files/folders names in it
            example
              /*
                 .gitignore/
                 ->  __pycache__
                     linuxvenv
                     winvenv
                     chatbot_data.json
                     plant_disease_app.zip
                     temp.html
              */

Large Files Upload
git lfs
    sudo dnf install git lfs
    git lfs install
    git lfs track "LagreFile.mkv"
        (LargeFile.mkv is Large File)
    git add .
    git status
    git commit -m "add Large File"
    git push origin main

Fixing Mistakes
    Case 1: staged changes
        git reset <- file name ->
        git reset
    Case 2: commited changes (for one commit)
        git reset HEAD~1
    Case 3: commited changes (for many commits)
        git reset <- commit hash ->
        git reset --hard <- commit hash ->

What is Forking
    A fork is a new repository that shares code and visibility settings with the original "upstream" repository.
    Fork is a rough copy.
