Apple Scab
Apple Scab is a severe fungal disease caused by Venturia inaequalis that results in dark, scabby lesions on leaves and fruit. The fungus overwinters in fallen leaves and releases spores during spring rains. This condition is of medium urgency, requiring immediate treatment to prevent fruit deformation and future yield loss. Symptoms manifest as olive-green velvety spots on leaves that turn black, yellowing and premature dropping of leaves, and brown, corky, scabby spots on the fruit surface which may crack or become misshapen. Natural control methods include applying a baking soda solution (1 tbsp per gallon of water), spraying Neem oil or compost tea during early fungal development, raking and destroying all fallen leaves in autumn to remove overwintering spores, and using bio-fungicides containing Bacillus subtilis. Chemical control options involve fungicides containing Myclobutanil or Captan, Difenoconazole sprays applied at the "green tip" stage, or copper-based sprays before blossoming. To prevent this disease, prune trees to open the canopy for improved airflow (as rapid drying reduces infection), plant resistant varieties like Honeycrisp, Liberty, or Enterprise, and avoid overhead irrigation. In the Gardenland Integrated Farming Model (Horticulture + Duckery + Apiary), ducks forage for pests and snails in the orchard floor, reducing biological vectors, while bees ensure high pollination rates for the apple crop.

Apple Black Rot
Black Rot is a fungal disease caused by Botryosphaeria obtusa causing leaf spots, limb cankers, and fruit rot. The fruit rot phase is often called "Botryosphaeria rot". It is a high-urgency disease that can destroy the entire fruit harvest and damage tree structure. Symptoms include small, purple spots on leaves that enlarge into circular "frog-eye" spots, fruit developing a firm, brown rot that turns black, infected fruit shriveling into hard "mummies" that stay on the tree, and reddish-brown cankers on branches and limbs. Natural control relies on rigorous sanitation, specifically removing all mummified fruit from the tree and ground, pruning out cankers 15cm below the visible damage, and burning pruned wood immediately (do not compost). Chemical control can be achieved with Thiophanate-methyl fungicides or Captan or Sulfur sprays applied during the growing season. Prevention requires keeping trees healthy to resist infection (such as watering during drought), protecting trees from mechanical injury and insect damage, and removing dead wood and brush piles from the orchard. In the Gardenland Integrated Farming Model (Horticulture + Poultry), chickens can be grazed under apple trees in rotation to eat larvae and break disease cycles in leaf litter, while their manure enriches the soil phosphorus.

Cedar Apple Rust
Cedar Apple Rust is a fungal disease caused by Gymnosporangium juniperi-virginianae that requires two hosts: apple trees and Eastern red cedar (juniper) trees; it cannot spread from apple to apple. This is a medium-urgency issue that is mainly cosmetic on leaves, but severe defoliation weakens the tree. Symptoms include bright yellow-orange "oil spots" on the upper surface of apple leaves, tiny black fungal bodies appearing in the spots, tube-like structures on the underside of leaves releasing spores, and premature leaf drop. Natural control involves removing Eastern Red Cedar trees within a 1-mile radius if possible and pruning "cedar galls" (brown, brain-like growths) from nearby junipers in late winter. Chemical control includes fungicides containing Myclobutanil (Immunox) or Mancozeb or Sulfur sprays applied when blossoms start to show pink. Prevention involves planting rust-resistant apple varieties (e.g., Red Delicious, McIntosh) and monitoring nearby landscaping for juniper infections. In the Gardenland Integrated Farming Model (Horticulture + Apiary), since this disease is airborne between hosts, livestock integration focuses on maintaining general tree health via bee pollination and manure fertilization from nearby cattle or goats.

Healthy Apple Tree
A healthy apple tree is vigorous with glossy green leaves, no spots, and smooth bark. The urgency level is low, and the recommendation is to maintain the current care routine. Prevention measures include mulching around the base to retain moisture, annual pruning in late winter, and balanced fertilization in early spring. In the Gardenland Integrated Farming Model (High-Density Orchard + Sheep), sheep can graze the alleyways between apple rows (managed grazing) to control weeds and reduce mowing costs.

No Plant Detected
The image does not appear to contain a recognized plant leaf. This is a low-urgency issue; please upload a clear image of a plant leaf. There are no specific symptoms, controls, or prevention methods applicable. Integrated farming is not applicable.

Healthy Blueberry
A healthy blueberry bush is thriving with dark green foliage. Blueberries require acidic soil (pH 4.5-5.5). The condition is good, with a low urgency level. Prevention involves testing soil pH annually and adding elemental sulfur if needed, as well as mulching with pine needles or sawdust to maintain acidity. In the Gardenland Integrated Farming Model (Horticulture + Apiculture), blueberries are highly dependent on bees for fruit set; keeping hives nearby increases yield by up to 30%.

Cherry Powdery Mildew
Powdery Mildew is a fungal disease caused by Podosphaera clandestina that covers leaves and fruit in white fungal growth, typically in warm, dry climates with high humidity. It is a medium-urgency disease that can deform fruit and stunt shoot growth. Symptoms include circular white, powdery patches on leaves, leaves curling upward and becoming distorted, white felt-like patches on fruit, and stunted twig growth. Natural control involves spraying with a mixture of milk and water (1:10 ratio), potassium bicarbonate sprays, or Neem oil or horticultural oil. Chemical control uses sulfur dust or wettable sulfur, or Myclobutanil or Fenbuconazole fungicides. Prevention focuses on pruning to improve light penetration and air circulation, avoiding nitrogen fertilizers late in the season (which promotes susceptible tender growth), and watering at the base to avoid wetting foliage. In the Gardenland Integrated Farming Model (Horticulture + Vermiculture), cherry orchard leaf litter is used in worm farms to create vermicompost, which is then returned to the trees as a nutrient-rich top dressing.

Healthy Cherry
A healthy cherry tree exhibits vibrant green leaves without curling or spots. The urgency level is low, requiring only continued monitoring. Prevention includes regular watering during fruit formation and using bird netting to protect the harvest. In the Gardenland Integrated Farming Model (Orchard + Poultry), chickens act as natural pest control for the cherry fruit fly larvae in the soil.

Gray Leaf Spot (Corn)
Gray Leaf Spot is a major fungal disease caused by Cercospora zeae-maydis favored by warm, humid weather. It limits the plant's photosynthetic capacity. It is a high-urgency disease that can severely reduce yield if it reaches the ear leaf during tasseling. Symptoms include small, pinpoint lesions surrounded by yellow halos, lesions elongating into rectangular, gray-to-tan spots running parallel to leaf veins, and entire leaves turning gray and dying (blight). Natural control involves deep tillage to bury infected crop residue (accelerating decomposition) and crop rotation (at least 2 years without corn). Chemical control uses fungicides with Azoxystrobin or Pyraclostrobin, or Propiconazole applied at the onset of disease. Prevention relies on planting resistant corn hybrids (the most effective method) and carefully managing residue in no-till systems. In the Dryland/Wetland Model (Agri-Silviculture: Crops + Trees), trees act as windbreaks to reduce spore spread, while leaf litter adds organic matter.

Common Rust (Corn)
Common Rust is a fungal disease caused by Puccinia sorghi that produces rust-colored pustules. Spores are carried by wind over long distances. It is usually a medium-urgency issue and manageable unless infection starts very early. Symptoms include small, circular to elongated brown/cinnamon pustules on both leaf surfaces, pustules turning black as the plant matures, and yellowing of leaf tissue around pustules. Natural control is usually not economically viable to treat organically in large fields, but early planting allows corn to mature before rust spores arrive. Chemical control includes fungicides containing Mancozeb or Strobilurins, applied only if pustules cover significant leaf area before grain fill. Prevention involves planting resistant hybrids and avoiding excessive nitrogen which promotes soft, susceptible growth. In the Dryland Model (Silvi-Pasture: Crop + Goat), corn residue (stover) can be grazed by cattle or goats after harvest.

Northern Leaf Blight
Northern Leaf Blight is caused by the fungus Exserohilum turcicum and thrives in cool, wet weather. It is a high-urgency condition that can cause significant grain loss if upper leaves are infected early. Symptoms include long, cigar-shaped lesions (1 to 6 inches) on leaves, lesions appearing gray-green eventually turning tan, and lesions coalescing to kill whole leaves. Natural control includes bio-fungicides containing Trichoderma harzianum and crop rotation with non-host crops (soybeans, alfalfa). Chemical control involves Mancozeb, Propiconazole, or Pyraclostrobin sprayed at the first sign of disease. Prevention includes tillage to reduce surface residue and planting resistant varieties. In the Dryland Model (Crop + Goat + Agroforestry), goats can eat the corn stover, the manure is composted and used, and trees provide microclimate regulation.

Healthy Corn
Healthy corn has strong stalks, deep green leaves, and developing ears. The urgency level is low, though monitoring for pests like armyworms is advised. Prevention involves maintaining consistent irrigation during silking. In the Wetland/Dryland "Zero Waste" model (Crop + Dairy), corn feeds cattle, cattle dung generates biogas for energy, and slurry fertilizes the next corn crop.

Black Rot (Grape)
Black Rot is a devastating fungal disease caused by Guignardia bidwellii attacking fruit and leaves. It thrives in warm, humid weather. This is a high-urgency disease that can cause 100% crop loss if untreated. Symptoms include small yellowish spots on leaves with dark borders, fruit turning brown, soft, then shriveling into hard black "mummies", and tiny black fungal dots (pycnidia) appearing on fruit and leaf spots. Sanitation is key for natural control: remove all mummies from vines and ground in winter, and ensure proper canopy management to increase airflow. Chemical control utilizes Mancozeb or Ziram, or Myclobutanil (Immunox) which is highly effective. Prevention involves planting in sunny locations with good air drainage and weed control under vines to reduce humidity. In the Gardenland Integrated Farming Model (Vineyard + Geese/Ducks), "Weeder Geese" manage grass and weeds without herbicides, reducing humidity around the vines which prevents Black Rot.

Esca (Black Measles)
Esca, or Black Measles, is a complex fungal trunk disease affecting older vines. It blocks water transport and releases toxins. This is a critical condition with no cure; it is incurable and fatal to the vine part. Symptoms include leaves showing "tiger stripes" (yellow/red distinct bands between veins), small dark spots on berries ("measles"), and sudden wilting of whole branches (apoplexy). Natural control involves removing infected vines and burning them, or trunk renewal by cutting the trunk below the infected area and training a new sucker. Chemical control is limited to wound sealants (paint/paste) on pruning cuts to prevent infection, as there are no chemical cures for established infection. Prevention requires disinfecting pruning tools between vines and avoiding pruning during wet weather. In the Gardenland Integrated Farming Model (Horticulture + Biogas), removed infected wood (carefully handled) or other farm waste is used for biogas generation, ensuring pathogens are destroyed by heat.

Isariopsis Leaf Spot
Isariopsis Leaf Spot is a fungal disease causing spotting and premature defoliation, weakening the vine. It is a medium-urgency issue that reduces vine vigor and next year's yield. Symptoms include irregular reddish-brown spots on leaves, fuzzy olive-brown fungal growth on the underside of spots, and leaves turning yellow and dropping early. Natural control uses copper-based organic fungicides and improved air circulation. Chemical control involves Mancozeb spray or Chlorothalonil. Prevention includes collecting and burning fallen leaves and using a dormant spray with Lime Sulfur. In the Gardenland Integrated Farming Model (Vineyard + Sheep), sheep graze the vineyard floor in winter (when vines are dormant) to eat fallen leaves and weeds, reducing fungal carryover.

Healthy Grape Vine
A healthy grape vine is robust with green, intact leaves. The urgency level is low. Prevention involves regular pruning and training. In the Gardenland Integrated Farming Model (Vineyard + Agritourism), healthy vineyards are ideal for integrating tourism, wine tasting, and selling byproduct jams/jellies.

Citrus Greening (HLB)
Citrus Greening is a bacterial disease caused by Candidatus Liberibacter spread by the Asian Citrus Psyllid. It blocks phloem, starving the roots. This is a critical global threat to citrus, and trees usually die within 5 years. Symptoms include asymmetrical blotchy mottling (yellowing) on leaves, yellow veins and corky veins, fruit staying green at the bottom (greening) and tasting bitter/salty, and misshapen, lopsided fruit. There is NO CURE; infected trees must be removed. Natural control involves releasing parasitic wasps (Tamarixia radiata) to control the psyllid vector. Chemical control uses systemic insecticides (Imidacloprid) to kill psyllids or antibiotic injections (Oxytetracycline) which can suppress symptoms but not cure. Prevention relies on using only certified disease-free nursery stock and aggressive monitoring and control of psyllids. In the Gardenland Integrated Farming Model (Citrus + Apiculture), while battling greening, maintaining high biodiversity is key; beehives support pollination of cover crops that attract beneficial insects (predators of psyllids).

Bacterial Spot (Peach)
Bacterial Spot is caused by Xanthomonas campestris. It causes defoliation and pitted fruit. This is a medium-urgency disease that makes fruit unmarketable. Symptoms include small, angular, water-soaked spots on leaves where the centers fall out leaving a "shot-hole" appearance, cracks and pits on the fruit surface, and leaves turning yellow and dropping. Natural control involves copper sprays (used cautiously, as they can burn peach leaves) and bacteriophages (viruses that kill bacteria) specifically for Xanthomonas. Chemical control uses Oxytetracycline (antibiotic) sprays (Mycoshield) or Copper ammonium complex. Prevention involves planting resistant varieties (e.g., Candor, Southern Pearl) and fertilizing appropriately to maintain vigor but avoid excess nitrogen. In the Gardenland Integrated Farming Model (Horticulture + Poultry), free-range chickens in the orchard help control plum curculio and other insect pests that create wounds where bacteria can enter.

Healthy Peach Tree
A healthy peach tree has leaves that are long, lanceolate, and green. The urgency level is low. Prevention involves dormant oil spray for scale insects. In the Gardenland Integrated Farming Model (Horticulture + Apiary), peaches are self-fertile but bees improve fruit size and quality.

Bacterial Spot (Pepper)
Bacterial Spot in peppers is a serious seed-borne bacterial disease spread by splashing water. It is a high-urgency issue that spreads rapidly in wet seasons. Symptoms include small, water-soaked spots on leaves that turn brown/black often with a yellow halo, raised, scab-like spots on the peppers, and leaf drop exposing fruit to sunscald. Natural control includes Copper fungicides (OMRI listed), removing infected plants immediately, and mulching to prevent soil splash. Chemical control involves fixed copper mixed with Mancozeb (more effective than copper alone) or Agri-Strep (Streptomycin). Prevention involves hot water seed treatment (122°F for 25 mins) and crop rotation (do not plant after tomato/potato). In the Gardenland Integrated Farming Model (Vegetable Crop + Vermicompost), vermicompost tea is used as a foliar spray; it has been shown to suppress bacterial spot severity.

Healthy Bell Pepper
A healthy bell pepper plant has sturdy stems and glossy green leaves. The urgency level is low. Prevention involves staking plants to keep fruit off the ground. In the Gardenland Integrated Farming Model (Crop + Biogas), pepper plant waste (post-harvest) is excellent for biogas digesters.

Early Blight (Potato)
Early Blight is a fungal disease caused by Alternaria solani affecting older leaves first. It stresses the plant and reduces tuber size. It is a medium-urgency disease manageable with good practices. Symptoms include dark brown spots with concentric rings (target board pattern), yellowing of tissue around the spots, and lower leaves dying and hanging on the stem. Natural control involves maintaining plant vigor with adequate nitrogen and phosphorus and using Bacillus subtilis bio-fungicide. Chemical control uses Chlorothalonil (Bravo), Mancozeb, or Azoxystrobin. Prevention relies on crop rotation (3-4 years) and drip irrigation to keep leaves dry. In the Dryland/Gardenland Integrated Farming Model (Crop + Dairy), potatoes have high nutrient demands; dairy manure (composted) provides the necessary bulk organic matter.

Late Blight (Potato)
Late Blight is the historical famine-causing pathogen Phytophthora infestans. It destroys foliage and rots tubers. This is a critical condition requiring the immediate destruction of infected plants as it is extremely contagious. Symptoms include large, dark, water-soaked blotches on leaves, white fuzzy fungal growth on the underside in humid weather, tubers with reddish-brown, granular rot under the skin, and a putrid smell. Natural control involves copper fungicides (preventative only) and killing vines (burn/cut) 2 weeks before harvest to prevent tuber infection. Chemical control uses Metalaxyl (often resistance issues), Cymoxanil, or Dimethomorph. Prevention focuses on eliminating "cull piles" (waste potatoes) where the fungus overwinters and using certified seed potatoes. In a broader livestock-crop mix (Pigs), pigs can root out and eat leftover tubers after harvest (gleaning), removing volunteer potatoes that would otherwise harbor Late Blight.

Healthy Potato
A healthy potato plant has bushy growth with no spots. The urgency level is low. Prevention involves hilling soil around stems. In the Dryland Integrated Farming Model (Crop + Agroforestry), alley cropping with nitrogen-fixing trees improves soil fertility for potatoes.

Healthy Raspberry
A healthy raspberry plant has upright canes and leaves that are green/silver underneath. The urgency level is low. Prevention involves pruning old canes after fruiting. In the Gardenland Integrated Farming Model (Horticulture + Apiary), raspberries are major nectar sources; integrating hives produces high-value raspberry honey.

Healthy Soybean
A healthy soybean plant is a legume crop with trifoliate leaves. The urgency level is low; monitoring for aphids is recommended. In the Dryland Model (Silvi-Pasture: Crop + Cattle), soybeans fix nitrogen; following soy with a grass crop for cattle grazing utilizes this nitrogen efficiently.

Powdery Mildew (Squash)
Powdery Mildew is an extremely common fungal disease on cucurbits. It blocks sunlight, killing leaves. It is a medium-urgency issue that should be treated early to prolong harvest. Symptoms include white, talcum-powder-like growth on upper and lower leaf surfaces, leaves turning yellow and brown, and premature ripening/sunburn of fruit due to leaf loss. Natural control includes Neem oil, milk spray (40% milk, 60% water), or sulfur dust. Chemical control uses Chlorothalonil or Myclobutanil. Prevention involves planting resistant varieties (e.g., PM-resistant zucchini) and spacing plants widely for airflow. In the Gardenland Integrated Farming Model (Crop + Apiculture), squash requires bees for pollination (male to female flowers); without bees, fruit will abort.

Leaf Scorch (Strawberry)
Leaf Scorch is a fungal disease caused by Diplocarpon earliana. It gives plants a "burned" look. It is a medium-urgency disease that can kill plants if severe. Symptoms include irregular purple blotches on leaves, centers of spots turning brown (not white like leaf spot), and leaves curling up and drying out (scorch). Natural control involves removing and burning infected leaves and applying copper fungicide. Chemical control uses Captan or Thiram, or Syngenta Switch. Prevention includes planting in well-draining soil and renewing strawberry beds every 3-4 years. In the Gardenland Integrated Farming Model (Horticulture + Rabbits), while rabbits are pests to strawberries, rabbit manure (cold manure) is one of the best fertilizers for strawberry beds if composted.

Healthy Strawberry
A healthy strawberry plant is a low-growing rosette with trifoliate leaves. The urgency level is low. Prevention involves mulching with straw to keep fruit clean. In the Gardenland Integrated Farming Model (Horticulture + Apiary), bees are essential for well-shaped berries.

Bacterial Spot (Tomato)
Bacterial Spot in tomatoes is caused by Xanthomonas bacteria, thriving in warm (75-85°F), wet conditions. It is a high-urgency disease that can severely damage fruit quality. Symptoms include small (1/8 inch) water-soaked spots on leaves that turn dark brown/black and may fall out, raised, scab-like spots on green fruit, and leaf yellowing and loss. Natural control uses copper-based bactericides, avoiding working in the garden when wet, and hot water seed treatment. Chemical control involves Copper hydroxide + Mancozeb (tank mix) or Streptomycin (agricultural grade). Prevention involves using drip irrigation, staking/caging plants to improve airflow, and rotating away from solanaceous crops for 2 years. In the Gardenland Integrated Farming Model (Crop + Biogas + Dairy), tomato plant residue is acidic but can be mixed with dairy slurry for biogas production.

Early Blight (Tomato)
Early Blight is caused by the fungus Alternaria solani and is the most common tomato disease. It is a medium-urgency issue that is treatable if caught early. Symptoms include brown spots with concentric rings ("bullseye") on lower leaves, surrounding leaf tissue turning yellow, stem cankers (dark, sunken spots), and fruit rot at the stem end. Natural control involves removing infected lower leaves (pruning), applying mulch to prevent soil spores splashing onto leaves, and bicarbonate sprays. Chemical control uses Chlorothalonil (Daconil) or Mancozeb. Prevention requires staking plants and ensuring adequate calcium and magnesium levels. In a broader livestock-crop integration (Poultry), chickens can range in the tomato patch after harvest to eat pests and diseased fallen fruit.

Late Blight (Tomato)
Late Blight is caused by Phytophthora infestans. It is aggressive and destructive, capable of killing plants in days. This is a critical condition requiring immediate action; infected plants must be isolated and destroyed. Symptoms include large, irregular gray-green patches on leaves that turn brown and papery, white fuzzy mold ring around spots in humidity, and firm, dark brown, rough rot on fruit. Natural control involves pulling and bagging infected plants immediately and using copper fungicides as a preventative. Chemical control uses Chlorothalonil (preventative) or Propamocarb hydrochloride (curative). Prevention relies on avoiding overhead watering completely and planting resistant varieties like "Mountain Magic" or "Defiant". In Aquaponics systems (Aquaculture-Agriculture), tomatoes thrive, and the controlled environment (greenhouse) prevents Late Blight spores from entering.

Leaf Mold
Leaf Mold is caused by the fungus Passalora fulva and is common in greenhouses or high humidity. It is a medium-urgency disease that reduces yield but rarely kills the plant. Symptoms include pale green or yellow spots on the upper leaf surface, olive-green or brown velvety mold on the underside, and leaves curling, withering, and dropping. Natural control involves increasing ventilation/spacing, copper sprays, and Neem oil. Chemical control uses Chlorothalonil or Difenoconazole. Prevention focuses on keeping humidity below 85% and using fans in greenhouses. In Aquaponics systems (Aquaculture-Agriculture), Leaf mold is a greenhouse issue; integrating fish tanks provides heat mass and nutrients while requiring strict humidity control.

Septoria Leaf Spot
Septoria Leaf Spot is caused by the fungus Septoria lycopersici. It affects leaves, not fruit. It is a medium-urgency disease that causes defoliation, exposing fruit to sunscald. Symptoms include numerous small, circular spots (1/16 to 1/8 inch) with dark margins and gray/white centers containing tiny black dots, starting at bottom leaves and moving up. Natural control involves removing lower leaves, applying copper fungicide, and mulching heavily. Chemical control uses Chlorothalonil or Mancozeb. Prevention includes sanitation (removing all crop debris at end of season) and a 3-year crop rotation. In the Wetland Integrated Farming Model (Crop + Mushroom), spent tomato haulms (stems) can be composted and used as a substrate component for certain mushroom species.

Two-Spotted Spider Mite
Two-Spotted Spider Mites are tiny arachnids that suck plant sap. They thrive in hot, dry conditions. They are a medium-urgency pest that can explode in population rapidly. Symptoms include yellow or white stippling (tiny dots) on leaves, fine webbing visible between leaves and stems, and leaves turning bronze/gray and brittle. Natural control involves a strong stream of water to knock them off, introduction of predatory mites (Phytoseiulus persimilis), and Neem oil or insecticidal soap. Chemical control uses Abamectin (Miticide) or Bifenazate. Prevention involves keeping plants well-watered (mites hate humidity) and avoiding broad-spectrum insecticides (they kill mite predators). In the Gardenland Integrated Farming Model (Horticulture + Mixed/Trap Cropping), planting marigolds or dill nearby attracts predatory insects that eat mites.

Target Spot
Target Spot is caused by the fungus Corynespora cassiicola. It is similar to Early Blight but attacks fruit more aggressively. It is a medium-urgency disease that can ruin fruit marketability. Symptoms include brown-black lesions with subtle concentric rings, sunken and firm lesions on fruit, and leaf centers cracking and falling out. Natural control uses copper fungicides and improved airflow. Chemical control involves Azoxystrobin or Pyraclostrobin. Prevention involves removing volunteer plants and avoiding wetting leaves. In the Gardenland Integrated Farming Model (Crop + Dairy), similar to other tomato fungal issues, soil health is key; composted dairy manure suppresses soil-borne phases of fungal pathogens.

Yellow Leaf Curl Virus (TYLCV)
Yellow Leaf Curl Virus (TYLCV) is a Begomovirus transmitted by Silverleaf Whiteflies. It halts fruit production. This is a high-urgency disease; plants infected early will produce no fruit. Symptoms include new leaves that are small, curled upward (cup-shaped), and yellow (chlorotic) at edges, stunted/dwarfed plants, and flowers dropping off. Natural control requires removing and bagging infected plants immediately (virus source), controlling whiteflies with sticky traps and Neem oil, and using reflective silver mulch to repel whiteflies. Chemical control uses Imidacloprid (systemic) to control the whitefly vector or Dinotefuran. Prevention involves using virus-resistant varieties (look for "TY" on label) and weed control (nightshade weeds host the virus). In the Gardenland Integrated Farming Model (Crop + Dairy + Biogas), integrated pest management within a dairy system helps reduce viral vectors.

Tomato Mosaic Virus (ToMV)
Tomato Mosaic Virus (ToMV) is a highly contagious virus (Tobamovirus). It is mechanically transmitted (tools, hands, tobacco products). It is a high-urgency, incurable condition resulting in permanent infection. Symptoms include light and dark green mottling (mosaic) on leaves, fern-like or distorted leaves, brown streaks on stems, and fruit ripening unevenly. Natural control involves removing infected plants and dipping tools in milk (the proteins in milk inactivate the virus) or bleach. No chemical controls exist for viruses. Prevention relies on washing hands after smoking (tobacco carries the virus) and planting resistant varieties (look for "T" or "Tm" on label). In the Gardenland Integrated Farming Model (Strict Sanitation in Crop + Dairy systems), ensure workers do not handle livestock/tobacco and then touch crops without sanitation.

Healthy Tomato
A healthy tomato plant exhibits vigorous growth, deep green leaves, and no wilting. The urgency level is low. Prevention involves regular sucker pruning. In the Gardenland Integrated Farming Model (Crop + Dairy + Biogas), planting basil with tomatoes improves flavor and repels flies/mosquitoes.

Unknown / Unclassified
The specific disease could not be identified with high confidence. The urgency level is low; users should consult a local agricultural extension office. There are no specific symptoms, natural or chemical controls listed. General prevention involves general IPM: monitor crops weekly, identify pests accurately, and use control thresholds. Integrated farming advice is general IPM.
